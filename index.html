    <h1>Operating a Toyota Forklift</h1>

    <p>At first, operating a forklift may seem quite daunting, but it is not too far off from driving a car! The key difference is that <strong>the rear wheels turn while steering rather than the front</strong>, which can lead to some odd-feeling movement which can be acclimated to over time. Without further ado, let's get started! You will have three pedals: The rightmost pedal is for gas, the middle for brake, then the leftmost for the engine brake. You will have a gear shifter on the left: flick up for forward, down for reverse, and leave in the middle for neutral. Finally, you have three levers: Leftmost for height adjustment on the forks, middle for tipping the mast (that's the part perpendicular to the forks) back and forth, then the rightmost lever for moving the forks from side to side. To operate, follow the following steps: First, you want to make sure that you are wearing your seat belt. <strong>Second, make sure the gear shifter is in the neutral position.</strong> Third, turn the key to start the engine. Fourth, move the gear shifter up or down to allow for travel. From here, you can pick up just about anything that the laws of physics will allow you to transport! <strong>Just be sure that you know how much your forklift weighs</strong> so that you do not pick up something too heavy! <strong>And always watch for pedestrians!</strong></p>
